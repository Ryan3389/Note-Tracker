# Note-Tracker

## Description
This is a note tracker. This app allows users to type in a task title and description, save it for later, or select an older note to view every detail. This works by utilizing express.js as a server, working with various end points to send the correct files based on the users selection on the front end. These routes utilize either GET, POST, or DELETE to achieve the desired functionality.
